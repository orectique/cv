Having, regretfully, missed the deadline for the Graduate Analyst application due to a combination of personal and health factors, I was quite thrilled to discover that Mandala Partners had an open Expression of Interest platform.

I'm Hari, a policy modeller currently working as a Junior Policy Advisor at the Australian Local Government Association. 

I can offer you strong simulation and modelling skills, a keen eye for detail, and a passion for policy analysis. 


I had my first out-of-classroom taste of policy analysis during my stint as an undergrad intern at Mandala in 2023. Seeing the nuance of the sort of work undertaken at the firm, I decided to come back to ANU to specialize in policy modelling and analysis. As such, I'm also concurrently working on a master's degree economics and policy at the Crawford School of Public Policy, ANU.
